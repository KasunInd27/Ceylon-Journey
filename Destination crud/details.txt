For Buddhists, it is the footprint of Buddha; for Hindus, it is the footprint of Shiva; for Christians, it is the footprint of Adam; and for Muslims, it is the footprint of Adam after he was expelled from the Garden of Eden.

Kabalana Beach

Kabalana Beach is a beautiful stretch of golden sand and clear blue water located in the southern coastal town of Ahangama, Sri Lanka. It’s a popular destination for surfers of all levels, as well as swimmers, sunbathers, and those looking for a relaxing beach getaway.

There are also several restaurants and cafes located along the beach, serving up delicious fresh seafood and other Sri Lankan dishes.
